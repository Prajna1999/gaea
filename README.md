# Geospatial Database Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Data Structures

1. Implement basic geometric types (Point, LineString, Polygon)
2. Develop a dynamic array for storing collections of geometries

## Phase 2: Storage Engine

1. Create a simple file-based storage system
2. Implement basic CRUD operations

## Phase 3: Indexing

1. Implement an R-tree for spatial indexing
2. Add B-tree for non-spatial attributes

## Phase 4: Query Engine

1. Develop a simple query parser
2. Implement basic spatial queries (contains, intersects, etc.)

## Phase 5: Concurrency

1. Add multi-threading support for concurrent reads
2. Implement locking mechanisms for write operations

## Phase 6: Advanced Features

1. Add support for more complex geometric operations
2. Implement a simple transaction system

## Phase 7: Optimization

1. Profile and optimize critical paths
2. Implement more efficient I/O and caching strategies

## Phase 8: Testing and Validation

1. Develop a comprehensive test suite
2. Perform stress testing and fix any identified issues
